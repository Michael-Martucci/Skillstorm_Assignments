// In polymorphism this is an example of constructor chaining and method overriding
/*  constructor chaining since the constructor uses the super keyword to call the constructor
from the parent class Flower and use the arguments for color and name*/
/*method overrding since test 1 over rides the print statement by accessing its own boolean
 * property to determine if the flower is in bloom or not and then return the associated description

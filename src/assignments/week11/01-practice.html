        <p>For sale: a reliable and rugged 1998 Ford F-150, perfect for those who need a dependable 
        workhorse or a sturdy off-road companion. This F-150 comes with a powerful 4.6L V8 engine paired 
        with an automatic transmission, ensuring smooth and effortless driving. With 145,000 miles on the 
        odometer, this truck has been well-maintained and still has plenty of life left in it.
        The paint is in good condition with only minor scratches and dings typical of a vehicle of this age. 
        No major rust issues, and the body is solid. The seats and carpets are clean with no significant wear 
        or tear. All interior features and controls are functioning properly.This truck runs and drives smoothly. 
        Recent maintenance includes an oil change, new brake pads, and a transmission fluid flush. No known 
        mechanical issues. I am the third owner of this F-150. It has been well cared for and primarily used for 
        light hauling and occasional off-road trips. No major accidents reported. Clean title in hand.</p>
